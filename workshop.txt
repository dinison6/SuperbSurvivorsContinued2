description=[h2]Bug fixes[/h2]
description=1. Better FPS compatibility - added a NPC spawn distance option. Spawn distances greater than 30 will actually cause npcs not to spawn when using Potato PC configuration of Better FPS mod. This is because NPCs cannot be loaded outside of the cell that the player has loaded in.

description=[h2]Recommended Optimizations[/h2]
description=1. Allocate more Ram  - Add this to ProjectZomboid64.json. and ProjectZomboid64.bat. Replace the equivalent -Xmx... and -Xms... with
description=-Xmx12g
description=-Xms6g
description=Make sure both are added. Xms determines Ram usage. Xmx determines max available memory.
description=
description=2. Run maximum of ~5 Npcs
description=3. Render less zombies at any one time - less in total or using Better FPS mod
description=4. Do not run the mod with standardized xp mods - Maybe? I notice some more lag
