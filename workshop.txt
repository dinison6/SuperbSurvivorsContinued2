description=[h2]Optimizations[/h2]
description=1. Survivors AI routine is now updated every 60 ticks (once per second when running 60fps) -  Previously every 20 ticks - To improve performance. AI does not need to roeconsider its status 3 times per second.
description=2. Combat performance nerfed to update once every 20 ticks (3 times per second on 60fps) -  Previously every 10 ticks - Improve performance and slightly nerf AI melee combat.

description=[h2]Bug fixes[/h2]
description=1. Better FPS compatibility - added a NPC spawn distance option. Spawn distances greater than 30 will actually cause npcs not to spawn when using Potato PC configuration of Better FPS mod. This is because NPCs cannot be loaded outside of the cell that the player has loaded in.
description=2. Fixed memory leak where survivor was unable to climb out of a window due to out of index bug - This was causing thousands of accumulating errors per stuck survivors

description=[h2]Recommended Optimizations[/h2]
description=1. Allocate more Ram  - Add this to ProjectZomboid64.json. and ProjectZomboid64.bat. Replace the equivalent -Xmx... and -Xms... with
description=-Xmx12g
description=-Xms6g
description=Make sure both are added. Xms determines Ram usage. Xmx determines max available memory. note 12g = 12 Gigs
description=
description=2. Run maximum of ~8 - 10 Npcs
description=3. Render less zombies at any one time - less in total or using Better FPS mod
description=4. Do not run the mod with standardized xp mods - Maybe? I notice some more lag
description=5. Do a youtube tutorial to improve gaming performance
